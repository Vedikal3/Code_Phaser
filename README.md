💻 Code Phaser – A Mini Compiler Project
Code Phaser is a modular compiler prototype developed in Python that processes arithmetic expressions through all major compilation phases — from lexical analysis to final code generation. It supports syntax tree visualization, intermediate code generation (Three-Address Code), and outputs to multiple languages including Assembly, C, C++, and Python (in progress).

🔧 Features
Lexical Analysis using Python’s re module

Syntax Analysis with visual trees via anytree

Semantic Analysis for identifier validation

Three-Address Code (TAC) generation

Assembly Code Output (completed)

C, C++, Python Code Generation (in development)

Modular Phase-Wise Architecture

Basic Code Optimization (in progress)

👥 Team Contributions
3-member collaboration with role-specific phase assignments

Each member implements 2 phases and 1 output language

📁 Technologies Used
Python 3, re, anytree

Command-line interface

Git for version control
