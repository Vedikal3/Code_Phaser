# **💻 Code Phaser – A Mini Compiler Project**

Code Phaser is a modular compiler prototype developed in Python that processes arithmetic expressions through all major compilation phases — from lexical analysis to final code generation. It supports syntax tree visualization, intermediate code generation (Three-Address Code), and outputs to multiple languages including Assembly, C, C++, and Python.

🔧 Features
✅ Lexical Analysis using Python’s re module

✅ Syntax Analysis with tree visualization via anytree

✅ Semantic Analysis for identifier and expression validation

✅ Intermediate Code Generation (Three-Address Code - TAC)

✅ Final Code Generation in:

Assembly

C

C++

Python

✅ Modular, Phase-Wise Architecture

✅ Basic Code Optimization (algebraic simplification)

📁 Technologies Used
Python 3

re (Regex)

anytree (for syntax/semantic tree visualization)

Command-line interface

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
